## 🌐 Translations

My Mods can be 100% translated with permission, you just need to let me know.
I won't translate my mods frequently due to my lack of experience with translation and the amount of work it takes me to translate it to a single language.
However, contributors are always welcome!
Check Modding:Translations on the wiki for help with translations.




## 🌀 Installation

First, install the latest versions of...

- SMAPI;
- Content Patcher;
- and other requirements if any.
> *(Check for other requirements on NexusMods)*
- Run the game using SMAPI.



## 💭 Reporting Bugs and Feedback

You can feel free to report bugs and send me feedbacks and even [suggestions](https://github.com/Doresuaan/Doresuaan/discussions) if you feel like it.
